# object-oriented-c

A project for messing around with OOP in C.

This repo showcases my attempt to mimic C++ inheritance in C. Would not recommend actually doing something
like this in production code because it gets messy. If you want inheritance, poloymorphism, type safety, etc.
you should really just use an OO language.
